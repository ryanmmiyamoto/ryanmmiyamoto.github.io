          <p style="line-height:30px; margin-left:13%;">Computer Science Seniors (CSS) was a team-oriented project at UCSD that focused on UX and UI design. Originally a ten week course, we were given just five weeks to form a team, conceptualize, prototype, revise and develop an innovative application. Our application, Homii, is a housing search engine for students that combines elements of real estate and social media to find the perfect living space and roommates for you.   </p>

          <p style="line-height:30px; margin-left:13%;">Our team consists of six computer science seniors from UCSD who have all experienced the difficulty of finding affordable housing in La Jolla, which had the highest home prices in the nation in 2008 and 2009. At the time, two of the team members were in the exact situation while looking for housing for the upcoming Fall quarter. Many housing search engines existed, but they were divided into two categories: (1) sites such as Zillow that do a great job of finding housing, but fail to help you find roommates or (2) sites like the Facebook UCSD Housing Group that does a great job of finding roommates, but fails to help you find real estate. We decided that this was an issue that was most pertinent to the class as it involves many students at UCSD. Thus, Homii was established. <br /> Other contenders included:  
          <ol style="line-height:30px; margin-left:13%;">
            <li><strong>- Social Scanner</strong> - An app that searches the surrounding area within a given radius for events and people nearby.</li>
            <li><strong>- Gym Goer</strong> - An app or website that lets you know how many people are in the gym at any given time so you can workout when it's least crowded</li>
            <li><strong>- Study Buddy</strong> - Students pin their location on a campus map as well as what theyre studying so that others around them can join them.</li>

            <p style="line-height:30px; margin-right:50px; text-align:justify; float:left;">Each member of the team was responsible for generating three logo prototypes using their method of choice. We then got together and discussed, which one best fit our needs. We ended up deciding on Wilson's android-inspired logo that was crafted from the team's initials (CSS) because its easily modifiable and unique. My logos were as follows and were designed around the name of our group, Computer Science Seniors. They were in consideration, but we decided that our logo should be more focused around our applications idea, rather than the name of our team. The next step was to create a more polished and final logo based on Wilson's design. I was having difficulty creating something I was satisifed with so I began experimenting with photoshop and other types of designs. I eventually came up with something I thought was a good fit for our team and it was a unanimous decision to use it as our team's logo. The logo can be seen at the <a href="teamcss.html#final_logo">top of this page.</a> </p>

            <p style="line-height:30px; margin-left:13%;">Needfinding was an important part of our design process because we were not entirely sure how responsive people would be to our idea. Using Google forms, we created a survey that asked a variety of questions pertaining to our idea, its features, and its usability. It turned out that people seemed very interested in using a lot of the features our app had to offer. It also helped in seeing what features we could eliminate as well as ones we had not even considered before. <br /><br />Once the needfinding phase was complete and we had validated that our problem and solution were indeed feasible, we began storyboarding and constructing user stories to capture the different scenarios our users might encounter. We divided this up by assigning one target audience per every two group members. They would then come up with 2 example personas and six storyboards showcasing the practicality of our website for their assigned target audience.  </p>  <br />

            <p style="line-height:30px; margin-right:50px; text-align:justify; float:left;">After two and a half weeks of Needfinding and Storyboarding, we can finally get our hands dirty with the actual design of our website. We started doing prototyping based on the storyboards we created and results from our needfinding research. Since we only have little time for team meeting, we decided that each member should make one prototype individually and then combine everything after they are tested. We agree on some filters and pages that should be on the prototype. My prototype is show on the right, but we decided to use Wilson's as a base for the next version as well as for the first round of user testing.</a> </p> <br />
            <p>During the first round of user testing the feedback was quite positive. We were paired with another six-person group and each one reviewed the site and gave feedback for any issues, critiques or suggestions they had. Some of the things   that were said included: 
            <ul style="line-height:30px; margin-right:50px; text-align:justify; float:left;">
              <li><strong>-</strong> "In order to find matching roommates like your description suggests, you probably need more filters"</li>
              <li><strong>-</strong> "Forcing the user to sign in just to search for listings will turn some off right away"</li>
              <li><strong>-</strong> "Space is limited, but you should have a map on the listing search page. It's pretty crucial for this type of website."
              <li><strong>-</strong> "The use of profiles in your website should be maximized by putting the preferences in the profile as filter by default." </li>
              <li><strong>-</strong> "Adding map or mapping feature will help the user a lot in filtering potential houses."" </li>
              <li><strong>-</strong> "The website should have a messaging feature to simplify communication."" </li>
              <li><strong>-</strong> "User preference should be saved in the profile."" </li>

          <br />
          <center><p style="line-height:30px; width:80%">
          After gathering feedback and taking note of the features we needed to add/change/delete, we made a middle-fidelity prototype using Balsamiq. This prototype had more detail as well as images, color and interactive ability through the use of button-style links (a sort of "wizard of oz" style prototype). With this interactive ability, users can navigate through the prototype as they would a normal website except it's a pdf and not a real website. Screenshots of the prototype are shown below.<br /> <strong>Changes from V1 include:</strong> </center>
          <ul style="margin-left:15%; margin-right:15%;">
          <li><strong>- </strong>Profile information that user needs to fill out when they sign up

          <li><strong>- </strong>Saved Listing page

          <li><strong>- </strong>A map on the homepage
          <li><strong>- </strong>Sign up page — we decided to require more basic information from the user when they sign up to increase user’s credibility. This change will also ease the process of filtering house search by taking information from the user housing preference.
          <li><strong>- </strong>Creating listing page — We decide to add option to create a listing on the homepage.
          <li><strong>- </strong>Help page — We decide to add a help page to help the user use our website. The user will be able to contact the website admin (us) or read the Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)
          <li><strong>- </strong>Saved Listing — A feature that we include in our ‘should-have’ that are requested by many users! Users would be able to save a listing of their choice for future use.
          <li><strong>- </strong>Map on homepage — There is now a map on the website homepage! 
          <li><strong>- </strong>Listing that appear on the search result will pop up as a red dot on the map.

          <br />
          <center><p style="line-height:30px; width:80%">
          We had two choices while deciding how to implement our final prototype. We were given the option to mock up our web app with software that could create a hi-fidelity prototype, or code the entire application. Being that we were a team of purely computer science majors, our team decided that the best way to approach this problem was to fully code the application. We divided the tasks into the different pages and assigned each individual whichever page they wanted to code up the most. Within the next few hours, we had created the skeleton to one of the pages and reaffirmed that coding the product was feasible before the due date. We set up a git repository in order to more easily manage the code.<br /> </center>

        <center>
          <br />
          <p style="line-height:30px; width:80%">As we continued coding out our application it slowly dawned on us that at the pace we we’re working at, we may not be able to complete a few of the core features necessary in order for our application to run. We back tracked to our original discussion of coding vs. mockup and decided that with the remaining time left, we needed to use Axure to create a hi-fidelity prototype. Unfortunately, no one in our group knew how to use Axure, so we were all forced to learn it and complete a fully functional high-fidelity prototype in two days. With the way our end product came out, I think we can be satisfied with the overall quality given the circumstances we were presented with. </p> <br />
